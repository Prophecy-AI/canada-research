The dataset is slightly imbalanced (75% positive class), and the evaluation metric is AUC-ROC where higher scores are better. The small image size makes this suitable for CNN-based approaches with relatively low computational requirements.\n\u2192 Metric direction: HIGHER is better\n============================================================",

Let me now provide a comprehensive summary of the findings:\n---\n## **COMPETITION DATA ANALYSIS REPORT**\n### **Data Type**\n**TEXT** - Text Normalization (Sequence-to-Sequence task for Russian language)\n### **Dataset Size and Shape**\n- **Training Set:** 9,515,325 tokens across 685,292 sentences\n  - Shape: (9,515,325, 5)\n  - Columns: sentence_id, token_id, class, before, after\n  - File size: 423.08 MB\n- **Test Set:** 1,059,191 tokens across 76,144 sentences\n  - Shape: (1,059,191, 3)\n  - Columns: sentence_id, token_id, before\n  - File size: 20.77 MB\n- **Average tokens per sentence:** ~13.9 tokens (both train and test)\n### **Target Distribution**\n**HIGHLY IMBALANCED** dataset with 15 token classes:\n1. **PLAIN** (69.61%) - 6,623,430 tokens - No normalization needed\n2. **PUNCT** (21.64%) - 2,058,978 tokens - Punctuation marks\n3. **CARDINAL** (2.58%) - 245,620 tokens - Numbers (e.g., \"254\" \u2192 \"\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435\")\n4. **LETTERS** (1.79%) - 170,659 tokens - Abbreviations (e.g., \"\u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420\" \u2192 \"\u0440 \u0441 \u0444 \u0441 \u0440\")\n5. **DATE** (1.76%) - 167,157 tokens - Dates (e.g., \"1862 \u0433\u043e\u0434\" \u2192 \"\u0442\u044b\u0441\u044f\u0447\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0441\u043e\u0442 \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0434\")\n6. **VERBATIM** (1.49%) - 141,875 tokens\n7. **ORDINAL** (0.44%) - 42,159 tokens - Ordinal numbers\n8. **MEASURE** (0.38%) - 36,388 tokens - Measurements\n9. **TELEPHONE** (0.10%) - 9,061 tokens - Phone numbers/ISBNs\n10. **DECIMAL** (0.07%) - 6,582 tokens\n11. **ELECTRONIC** (0.06%) - 5,272 tokens - URLs/emails\n12. **MONEY** (0.03%) - 2,404 tokens\n13. **FRACTION** (0.02%) - 2,185 tokens\n14. **DIGIT** (0.02%) - 1,786 tokens\n15. **TIME** (0.02%) - 1,769 tokens\n**Class balance ratio:** 3,744:1 (max/min) - extremely imbalanced\n### **Key Patterns and Characteristics**\n1. **Self-normalization dominance:** 87.49% of tokens require no change (before == after)\n2. **Normalization needed:** Only 12.51% (1,190,307 tokens) require actual transformation\n3. **Transliteration:** 4.89% of tokens contain \"_trans\" suffix for foreign names/words\n4. **Vocabulary overlap:** 73.23% of test tokens appear in training set\n5. **Unseen tokens:** 49,661 unique tokens in test not seen during training (26.77%)\n6. **Token length:**\n   - Before: mean 5.06 chars, max 230 chars\n   - After: mean 8.10 chars, max 1,003 chars (normalized text is longer)\n7. **Missing values:** 11 in train 'before', 3 in test 'before' (minimal)\n8. **Context matters:** Tokens are grouped by sentence_id, suggesting context is important\n9. **Complex transformations:** Dates, numbers, and URLs require sophisticated rule-based or learned transformations\n### **CRITICAL - Evaluation Metric with Direction**\n**Evaluation Metric:** Prediction Accuracy (HIGHER is better)\n- **Definition:** Total percent of correct tokens\n- **Requirement:** Exact string match required (case-sensitive)\n- **Scoring:** Any error in output = wrong prediction\n- **Note:** Duplicate sentences in train/test are ignored in scoring\n---\n**Key Challenge:** The task requires handling 15 different token classes with distinct normalization rules, including complex transformations for dates, numbers, measurements, and transliteration of foreign words into Russian phonetic equivalents.\n\u2192 Metric direction: HIGHER is better\n============================================================",
