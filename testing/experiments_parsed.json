Let me now provide a comprehensive report of the findings:\n## **AERIAL CACTUS IDENTIFICATION - EDA REPORT**\n### **Data Type**\n- **Image Classification** (Binary)\n- Task: Identify presence of columnar cactus (Neobuxbaumia tetetzo) in aerial imagery\n### **Dataset Size and Shape**\n- **Training images:** 14,175 images\n- **Test images:** 3,325 images\n- **Total images:** 17,500 images\n- **Image dimensions:** 32√ó32 pixels (RGB)\n- **Training CSV shape:** (14175, 2) - contains 'id' and 'has_cactus' columns\n- **Test CSV shape:** (3325, 2) - contains 'id' and 'has_cactus' (placeholder) columns\n### **Target Distribution**\n- **Class 0 (no cactus):** 3,547 images (25.02%)\n- **Class 1 (has cactus):** 10,628 images (74.98%)\n- **Class imbalance ratio:** 3.00:1\n- **Balance status:** **SLIGHTLY IMBALANCED** - The dataset has about 3 times more images with cactus than without\n### **Key Patterns and Characteristics**\n1. **Image Properties:**\n   - All images are uniform 32√ó32 pixels (RGB format)\n   - JPEG format, standard compression\n   - Pixel values range from 0-255 (standard 8-bit RGB)\n   - Mean pixel values range from ~74 to ~186 across samples\n2. **Data Quality:**\n   - No missing values in CSV files\n   - 100% file consistency - all CSV entries have corresponding images\n   - All images accessible and properly formatted\n3. **Visual Characteristics:**\n   - Aerial photography perspective\n   - Small thumbnail size (32√ó32) makes this computationally efficient\n   - Similar average brightness between classes (132.54 vs 133.90), suggesting brightness alone won't be a strong discriminator\n4. **Task Complexity:**\n   - Binary classification problem\n   - Small image size may limit fine detail but reduces computational requirements\n   - Class imbalance favors positive class (has cactus)\n### **CRITICAL - Evaluation Metric with Direction:**\n**Evaluation Metric: AUC-ROC (HIGHER is better)**\n- Range: [0, 1] where 1.0 is perfect classification\n- Requires probability predictions (not binary labels)\n- Robust to class imbalance\n- Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all classification thresholds\n---\n**Summary:** This is a binary image classification task with 14,175 training images of 32√ó32 aerial photos. The dataset is slightly imbalanced (75% positive class), and the evaluation metric is AUC-ROC where higher scores are better. The small image size makes this suitable for CNN-based approaches with relatively low computational requirements.\n‚Üí Metric direction: HIGHER is better\n============================================================",
