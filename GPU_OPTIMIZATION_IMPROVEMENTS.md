# GPU Optimization & Training Efficiency Improvements

## Problem Analysis

### Training Failures Observed

1. **Library version conflicts** (albumentations/albucore incompatibility)
2. **Incorrect timm API usage** (timm.loss not accessible)
3. **Training too slow** - didn't finish within time budget
4. **No submission generated** - predict.py never ran because training consumed all available time

### Root Cause: Inefficient GPU Utilization

The agent was not maximizing GPU throughput, leading to slow training that couldn't complete in time.

## Improvements Applied

### 1. Enhanced DataLoader Configuration

**Before:**
```python
DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=BATCH, num_workers=min(8, os.cpu_count()//2),
           pin_memory=True, prefetch_factor=2)
```

**After:**
```python
DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=BATCH, num_workers=8-12,
           pin_memory=True, prefetch_factor=3-4, persistent_workers=True)
```

**Impact:**
- Higher `num_workers` (8-12) → More parallel data loading while GPU computes
- Higher `prefetch_factor` (3-4) → More batches ready in advance
- `persistent_workers=True` → Avoid worker respawn overhead between epochs
- **Expected speedup: 20-40% faster data loading**

### 2. Added Gradient Accumulation Pattern

For cases where batch size is limited by memory:

```python
accumulation_steps = 4  # Effective batch = batch_size * 4
for i, (data, target) in enumerate(loader):
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, target) / accumulation_steps
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        scaler.step(optimizer)
        scaler.update()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

**Impact:** Simulate larger batch sizes without OOM, improving convergence

### 3. Training Efficiency Tips

Added specific guidance:
- **torch.compile(model)** for PyTorch 2.0+ → 20-30% speedup
- **Reduce cv_folds** if time-critical (3 folds instead of 5)
- **Smaller max_epochs** with early stopping (patience=3-5)
- **Speed benchmarks:** Should process ≥100 batches/min (image), ≥500 batches/min (tabular)
- **Use pretrained models** (timm.models with pretrained=True)

### 4. Critical Time Management Section

**New guidance for avoiding training timeouts:**

```
• TIME MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL):
  - Estimate total training time before starting (epochs × steps_per_epoch × seconds_per_step)
  - If estimated time > 80% of total budget: Reduce cv_folds from 5→3, or max_epochs by 30-50%
  - Monitor training speed continuously - if first fold takes >20% of budget, adjust strategy immediately
  - Always reserve 15% of time for inference/submission generation - kill training early if needed
  - Use early stopping aggressively (patience=3-5 epochs) to avoid wasting time on plateaued models
```

**Workflow updated:**
```
6. If training taking too long (>70% of time budget used), kill training and run predict.py with partial models
7. When training completes OR when killed early, immediately run predict.py to generate submission
```

### 5. Graceful Degradation for predict.py

**New requirement:**
```
• CRITICAL: predict.py must handle incomplete training gracefully - check which model files exist,
  use available models, generate submission even if not all folds completed
```

**Implementation pattern:**
```python
# In predict.py
import glob

# Find available model files
model_files = sorted(glob.glob('model_fold*.pth'))
print(f"Found {len(model_files)} trained models: {model_files}")

# Load and ensemble available models
predictions = []
for model_path in model_files:
    model = load_model(model_path)
    predictions.append(model.predict(test_data))

# Average predictions (even if incomplete)
final_pred = np.mean(predictions, axis=0)
```

### 6. Enhanced GPU Monitoring

**Updated threshold:**
```
• Monitor GPU utilization: Low util (<70%) = batch too small or CPU bottleneck
  (increase batch or num_workers)
```

**Enhanced resource printing:**
```python
print(f"RESOURCES: {os.cpu_count()} CPU cores, batch={BATCH_SIZE}, GPU={torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}, Mixed Precision={'ON' if USE_AMP else 'OFF'}")
print(f"GPU Memory: {torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1024**3:.1f} GB")
print(f"DataLoader: num_workers={NUM_WORKERS}, prefetch_factor={PREFETCH_FACTOR}, persistent_workers={PERSISTENT_WORKERS}")
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- DataLoader: 4-6 workers, prefetch_factor=2
- No gradient accumulation guidance
- No time management strategy
- Training runs until complete or timeout (no graceful early stopping)
- predict.py expects all models to exist

**Result:** Training timeout, no submission generated

### After Optimizations:
- DataLoader: 8-12 workers, prefetch_factor=3-4, persistent_workers=True
- Gradient accumulation for effective larger batches
- Proactive time estimation and adjustment
- Early training termination with partial models
- predict.py handles incomplete training

**Expected Result:**
- **20-40% faster data loading** (better DataLoader config)
- **20-30% faster model execution** (torch.compile)
- **2-3x faster training** (mixed precision - already in prompt)
- **Better time management** (early stopping when needed)
- **Always generate submission** (graceful degradation)

### Combined Impact:
- **Previous: 75 min estimated training → timeout → no submission**
- **Expected: 20-30 min actual training → early stop → submission generated**

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify DataLoader improvements:**
   ```python
   # In train.py, add timing:
   import time
   start = time.time()
   for batch in train_loader:
       pass
   print(f"Data loading speed: {len(train_loader)/(time.time()-start):.1f} batches/sec")
   ```

2. **Monitor GPU utilization:**
   ```bash
   watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
   ```
   Should see **70-90% GPU utilization** during training

3. **Check time estimation:**
   Agent should print estimated training time and adjust cv_folds/epochs if needed

4. **Verify graceful degradation:**
   Manually kill training after 2 folds, verify predict.py generates submission with 2 models
