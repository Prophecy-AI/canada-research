# Agent Improvements Summary - ElapsedTime Tool & Oracle Enhancements

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive improvements to the Kaggle agent based on user feedback:
1. Created ElapsedTime tool for time budget tracking
2. Enhanced Oracle consultation during passive monitoring
3. Added realistic goal setting guidance (gold vs silver tradeoffs)
4. Integrated continuous Oracle feedback loop during training

## 1. ElapsedTime Tool Implementation

### Created: `/Users/Yifan/canada-research/agent_v5/tools/elapsed_time.py`

**Purpose:** Allow agent to track elapsed time and make time-aware decisions

**Features:**
- Tracks time since agent initialization
- Calculates percentage of 30-minute budget used
- Provides time-aware guidance (urgency levels: low/medium/high/critical)
- Context-aware recommendations based on time remaining

**Example Output:**
```
⏱️  ELAPSED TIME: 15m 0s (15 minutes)
📊 Time Budget: 50.0% of 30-minute budget used
🎯 Status: On track - target time
⚡ Urgency: MEDIUM

GUIDANCE:
• You're in the target window - maintain pace
• If training still running, monitor progress
• Start predict.py soon if not already done
```

**Integration:**
- Added to `agent_v5/agent.py`:
  - Import: `from agent_v5.tools.elapsed_time import ElapsedTimeTool`
  - Constructor: Added `start_time` parameter to `ResearchAgent.__init__()`
  - Registration: `self.tools.register(ElapsedTimeTool(self.workspace_dir, self.start_time))`

## 2. Enhanced Oracle Prompt - Realistic Goal Setting

### Modified: `/Users/Yifan/canada-research/agent_v5/tools/oracle.py`

**Added Section: "REALISTIC GOAL SETTING (CRITICAL)"**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Gold medal is the GOAL, but NOT always achievable**
- **Time/EV Tradeoff:** Silver medal in 20 min > gold medal in 120 min (if improvement uncertain)
- **When to settle for less than gold:**
  - Competition requires massive ensembles (50+ models)
  - Competition requires extensive feature engineering (weeks of domain expertise)
  - Gold threshold requires <0.001 score improvement (diminishing returns)
  - Competition has 5000+ teams with near-identical scores at top
- **When to push for gold:**
  - Gap to gold is small (<5% score improvement)
  - Clear strategy exists (e.g., add one model type, fix obvious bug)
  - Competition rewards clean approach over massive compute
- **Be REALISTIC in estimates:**
  - If adding ResNet-50 to ensemble gave +0.002 improvement, adding ResNet-101 won't give +0.010
  - If 3 models plateau, adding 10 more won't magically break through
  - If silver score is 0.85 and gold is 0.95, that's likely impossible without domain breakthroughs

**Impact:** Oracle will now provide realistic assessments of whether gold is achievable and recommend settling for silver/bronze when appropriate.

## 3. Agent System Prompt - Realistic Goal Setting

### Modified: `/Users/Yifan/canada-research/mle-bench/agents/agent_v5_kaggle/kaggle_agent.py`

**Added Section at Line 21-39:** Same "REALISTIC GOAL SETTING (CRITICAL)" guidance as Oracle

**Benefits:**
- Agent understands when to settle for less than gold
- Considers time/EV tradeoffs proactively
- Focuses on efficiency over perfection
- Makes realistic estimates about improvement potential

---

## 4. Oracle Consultation During Passive Monitoring

### Modified: `/Users/Yifan/canada-research/mle-bench/agents/agent_v5_kaggle/kaggle_agent.py`

**Added Step 9 in CRITICAL WORKFLOW (Lines 185-200):**

```
9. ORACLE CONSULTATION DURING PASSIVE MONITORING (every 5-10 min while training runs):
   - Use ElapsedTime tool to check time spent and % of budget used
   - Use ReadBashOutput to get latest training logs (epochs completed, losses, GPU usage)
   - Consult Oracle with comprehensive context:
     * "I've been working for X minutes (Y% of 30-min budget used)"
     * "Training logs: [paste recent epoch outputs showing GPU usage, losses, speed]"
     * "Current GPU: XX.X GB / 24.0 GB (ZZ%)"
     * "Current strategy: N folds × M epochs, batch_size=B, num_workers=W"
     * "Expected completion: ~A more minutes"
     * "Ask Oracle: Critique my current process, identify resource underutilization,
       check if on track for time budget, recommend next steps"
   - Oracle will analyze:
     * Resource utilization patterns (GPU/CPU underused?)
     * Time trajectory (will we finish in budget?)
     * Training progress (converging properly? early stopping needed?)
     * Next steps (continue? kill and pivot? adjust strategy?)
   - Take Oracle's guidance seriously - if Oracle says kill training, do it immediately
```

**Benefits:**
- Continuous expert feedback during training
- Catches resource underutilization early
- Time-aware decision making (Oracle sees elapsed time and budget)
- Proactive strategy adjustments before wasting hours
- Oracle can recommend killing training if trajectory is bad

## 5. Tool Description Update

### Modified: `/Users/Yifan/canada-research/mle-bench/agents/agent_v5_kaggle/kaggle_agent.py`

**Updated Oracle tool description (Lines 58-65):**
```
- ElapsedTime: Check how long you've been working (tracks against 20±10 min budget).
  Use every 5-10 minutes to stay on track.

- Oracle (O3 + DeepSeek-R1 Grandmaster): WORLD-CLASS KAGGLE EXPERT for strategic planning,
  code review, and debugging. Use for:
  - Initial competition strategy (MANDATORY)
  - Code review before training (MANDATORY)
  - During training monitoring (every 5-10 min): Share training logs, GPU usage,
    resource utilization, elapsed time - get critique and next steps
  - After training completes: Share results, get improvement suggestions
  - CV/leaderboard mismatch, bug identification, stuck after failures
```

## Testing

✅ **ElapsedTimeTool Tested:**
- Created test at `/Users/Yifan/canada-research/test_elapsed_time.py`
- Verified behavior at 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 minutes elapsed
- Confirmed correct urgency levels and guidance
- Test cleaned up after validation

✅ **Integration Verified:**
- Tool properly imported in `agent.py`
- Tool registered in `_register_core_tools()`
- `start_time` parameter added to `ResearchAgent.__init__()`
- Tool appears in agent's available tools list

---

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before These Changes:
- Agent had no time awareness during execution
- No continuous Oracle feedback during training
- No guidance on gold vs silver tradeoffs
- Agent would pursue gold medal at any time cost

### After These Changes:
- **Agent checks elapsed time regularly** (every 5-10 min)
- **Agent consults Oracle during passive monitoring** with:
  - Training logs (GPU usage, losses, speed)
  - Resource utilization metrics
  - Elapsed time and time budget status
  - Current strategy details
- **Oracle provides time-aware feedback:**
  - "You're at 60% of budget, training will take 25 more min → kill and pivot to faster model"
  - "GPU at 15%, batch_size too small → increase to 256"
  - "This competition needs 100 models for gold, settle for silver"
- **Agent makes realistic decisions:**
  - Considers time/EV tradeoffs
  - Settles for silver when gold is unrealistic
  - Focuses on efficiency over perfection

## Impact on Agent Performance

### Time Management:
- **Before:** Agent could run indefinitely, no awareness of time spent
- **After:** Agent tracks time and adjusts strategy dynamically

### Resource Utilization:
- **Before:** Agent might run with 10% GPU usage for 60+ minutes
- **After:** Oracle catches underutilization at 5-min mark → agent increases batch_size

### Goal Setting:
- **Before:** Agent always pursues gold medal regardless of feasibility
- **After:** Agent makes realistic decisions (silver in 20 min vs gold in 120 min)

### Expert Guidance:
- **Before:** Oracle consulted only at start and end
- **After:** Oracle consulted every 5-10 min during training with detailed context

## Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **Test in real competition run:**
   - Verify agent actually uses ElapsedTime tool
   - Verify agent consults Oracle during monitoring
   - Check if Oracle provides useful time-aware guidance

2. **Potential refinements:**
   - Adjust monitoring frequency (currently 5-10 min)
   - Tune urgency thresholds (currently 10/20/25/30 min)
   - Add more context to Oracle consultations (model architecture, dataset size)

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update agent architecture docs with ElapsedTime tool
   - Add example Oracle consultation format to CLAUDE.md
