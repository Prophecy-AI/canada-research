TASK: Convert natural language queries into executable BigQuery Standard SQL.

CRITICAL: Output ONLY the SQL query. No explanations, no descriptions, no text before or after the SQL.

TABLE: {table_name}

KEY COLUMNS:
- npi_number: STRING - National Provider Identifier
- title: STRING - Professional title of the provider
- specialty: STRING - Medical specialty
- certifications: ARRAY<STRING> - Certifications held by the provider
- education: ARRAY<STRING> - Educational background of the provider
- awards: ARRAY<STRING> - Awards received by the provider
- memberships: ARRAY<STRING> - Professional memberships of the provider
- conditions_treated: ARRAY<STRING> - Conditions treated by the provider

COLUMN SELECTION PRIORITY:
- NEVER use SELECT * - be extremely selective with columns

AGGREGATION RULES:
- For counting providers: COUNT(DISTINCT npi_number)

ITEM MATCHING:
- Use UPPER() for case-insensitive item matching
- Use LIKE for partial matching when appropriate
- Check multiple name fields: certifications, education, awards, memberships, conditions_treated
- Example: WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM UNNEST(field) AS something
  WHERE UPPER(something) LIKE '%item%'
);

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return clean, executable BigQuery Standard SQL
- Include appropriate GROUP BY when using aggregations
- Add ORDER BY for meaningful result ordering
- LIMIT results to 1,000,000 (1M) rows
