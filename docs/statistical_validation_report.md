# High-Value Prescriber Profiling: A Statistical Validation Study

**Identifying Characteristics that Distinguish Top Revenue-Generating Healthcare Prescribers**

---

## Abstract

**Background:** Understanding characteristics that distinguish high-value prescribers from their peers is critical for pharmaceutical market strategy and resource allocation. However, systematic statistical validation of distinguishing features across multiple domains remains limited.

**Methods:** We analyzed 61,091 prescribers generating $77.5 billion in prescription revenue from January 2023 to September 2025. Prescribers were stratified into top 10% (n=6,110, ≥$2.67M revenue) and bottom 90% (n=54,981, <$2.67M revenue) segments. We compared 17 characteristics across five domains: portfolio composition (3 features), financial relationships (4 features), clinical practice (7 features), geographic distribution (1 feature), and temporal dynamics (4 features). Statistical significance was assessed using Mann-Whitney U tests, chi-square tests, and Pearson/Spearman correlations with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction (α = 0.05). Effect sizes were reported using Cohen's d and Cramér's V. Predictive modeling employed logistic regression with 80/20 train-test split and standardized features.

**Results:** Top 10% prescribers generated 64.8% of total revenue with 16-fold higher mean revenue ($8.22M vs $0.50M, p < 0.001). Portfolio diversity showed the largest effect (unique drugs: 7.4 vs 3.0, Cohen's d = 2.0, large effect). Logistic regression achieved ROC-AUC 0.9165, identifying five sufficient characteristics (unique_drugs, medicaid_rate, unique_procedures, commercial_rate, medicare_rate) and five necessary characteristics (unique_products_paid, unique_conditions, growth_rate_monthly, avg_days_supply, supply_90day_rate). Paradoxically, high-value prescribers exhibited faster declining growth rates (-1.97 vs -0.36 prescriptions/month, d = -0.698, medium effect).

**Conclusions:** Portfolio diversity is the primary discriminator of high-value prescribers, with excellent predictive performance (0.92 AUC). Financial alignment and clinical complexity show smaller but significant effects. The observed declining growth in high-value segments warrants investigation for retention strategies. These findings provide actionable insights for precision targeting in pharmaceutical strategy.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Healthcare prescriber segmentation is fundamental to pharmaceutical market strategy, enabling resource optimization and targeted engagement. Traditional approaches rely on prescription volume or revenue thresholds without systematic characterization of distinguishing features. Understanding what makes high-value prescribers different from their peers requires comprehensive statistical validation across multiple domains: clinical practice patterns, financial relationships, portfolio composition, and temporal dynamics.

Previous work has identified isolated factors such as specialty concentration, geographic clustering, or pharma payment relationships. However, a comprehensive multivariate analysis with rigorous statistical validation—including effect size estimation, multiple comparison correction, and predictive modeling—has been limited in the published literature.

### 1.2 Research Gap

While descriptive segmentation is common, three critical gaps remain:

1. **Insufficient statistical rigor:** Many analyses report significance without effect sizes or multiple comparison corrections, leading to potentially spurious findings.

2. **Limited multivariate perspective:** Most studies focus on single-domain characteristics (e.g., only financial metrics) rather than comprehensive profiling across clinical, financial, and behavioral domains.

3. **Lack of predictive validation:** Descriptive comparisons are valuable, but predictive models are necessary to identify which characteristics are **necessary** (absence predicts low-value) versus **sufficient** (presence predicts high-value).

### 1.3 Objectives

This study addresses these gaps through three aims:

**Aim 1:** Systematically profile top 10% revenue-generating prescribers using 17 characteristics across five domains with comprehensive statistical validation (effect sizes, FDR correction).

**Aim 2:** Identify necessary versus sufficient characteristics using logistic regression with feature importance analysis.

**Aim 3:** Quantify predictive performance and discriminative power of identified characteristics.

### 1.4 Hypothesis

We hypothesized that high-value prescribers would be distinguished by a combination of portfolio diversity (broader drug formulary), financial alignment (pharma payment-product concordance), and clinical complexity (managing more complex patients with multiple comorbidities).

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Data Sources

This study integrated four healthcare datasets:

1. **rx_claims** (Prescription Claims):
   - Prescription-level data including drug name (NDC), prescriber NPI, total paid amount, days supply, payer channel, and service date
   - Time range: January 2023 to September 2025

2. **med_claims** (Medical Claims):
   - Patient encounter data with diagnosis codes (conditions) and procedure codes
   - Linked to prescriber NPI for clinical complexity assessment

3. **provider_payments** (Pharma Payments):
   - Open Payments data with prescriber NPI, payment amount, payment count, and associated product
   - Used to assess financial relationships and payment-product alignment

4. **providers_bio** (Provider Biographical Data):
   - Certification counts, education credentials, awards, memberships, and conditions treated
   - Linked to prescriber NPI for biographical enrichment

All datasets were stored in BigQuery (project: unique-bonbon-472921-q8) and queried using Polars DataFrames for analysis.

### 2.2 Sample Selection

**Inclusion criteria:**
- Prescribers with ≥1 prescription in rx_claims during study period
- Non-null prescriber NPI
- Total revenue > $0

**Exclusion criteria:**
- Missing NPI
- Zero prescription count

**Final sample:** 61,091 prescribers generating $77,543,916,607 in total revenue.

### 2.3 Segmentation Strategy

Prescribers were stratified using the 90th percentile of total prescription revenue:

- **Top 10% (high-value):** n = 6,110, revenue ≥ $2,673,193
- **Bottom 90% (low-value):** n = 54,981, revenue < $2,673,193

The 90th percentile threshold was chosen to identify truly exceptional performers while maintaining adequate sample size for statistical power.

### 2.4 Feature Engineering

We engineered 17 characteristics across five domains:

**Portfolio Composition (3 features):**
1. `unique_drugs`: Count of distinct NDC drugs prescribed
2. `brand_rate`: Proportion of branded (vs generic) prescriptions
3. `revenue_per_rx`: Average revenue per prescription (efficiency metric)

**Financial Relationships (4 features):**
4. `receives_payments`: Binary indicator of pharma payment receipt
5. `total_payments`: Total pharma payment amount received
6. `payment_count`: Number of pharma payment transactions
7. `unique_products_paid`: Count of distinct products associated with payments

**Clinical Practice (7 features):**
8. `unique_conditions`: Count of distinct diagnosis codes from medical claims
9. `unique_procedures`: Count of distinct procedure codes from medical claims
10. `procedure_rate`: Proportion of medical claims with procedures
11. `certification_count`: Number of board certifications
12. `education_count`: Number of education credentials
13. `award_count`: Number of professional awards
14. `membership_count`: Number of professional memberships

**Geographic & Market (1 feature):**
15. `state`: Geographic location (used for distribution analysis)

**Payer Mix (3 features):**
16. `commercial_rate`: Proportion of commercial payer prescriptions
17. `medicare_rate`: Proportion of Medicare prescriptions
18. `medicaid_rate`: Proportion of Medicaid prescriptions

**Temporal Dynamics (4 features):**
19. `growth_rate_monthly`: Linear regression slope of monthly prescription counts (velocity)
20. `supply_90day_rate`: Proportion of prescriptions with 90-day supply (retention proxy)
21. `avg_days_supply`: Mean days supply per prescription
22. `prescription_count`: Total number of prescriptions (volume)

All features were calculated at the prescriber level by aggregating prescription-level, payment-level, and claim-level data.

### 2.5 Statistical Framework

**2.5.1 Univariate Comparisons**

For continuous variables:
- **Test:** Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric, appropriate for skewed revenue distributions)
- **Effect size:** Cohen's d = (mean₁ - mean₂) / pooled_std
  - Small: |d| = 0.2
  - Medium: |d| = 0.5
  - Large: |d| = 0.8

For categorical variables:
- **Test:** Chi-square test of independence
- **Effect size:** Cramér's V = √(χ² / (n × df))
  - Small: V = 0.1
  - Medium: V = 0.3
  - Large: V = 0.5

For correlations:
- **Test:** Pearson (linear) and Spearman (monotonic) correlations
- **Effect size:** |r| < 0.3 (weak), 0.3-0.5 (moderate), >0.5 (strong)

**2.5.2 Multiple Comparison Correction**

Given 17 statistical tests, false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure:
- Rank p-values from smallest to largest
- Compare each p_i to (i/m) × α where m=17, α=0.05
- Reject H₀ for all p_i ≤ p_max meeting criterion

**2.5.3 Predictive Modeling**

Logistic regression was employed to identify necessary versus sufficient characteristics:

**Model specification:**
```
P(high-value) = σ(β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + β₁₇X₁₇)
```

where σ is the logistic function, β are coefficients, and X are standardized features.

**Data preparation:**
- Features standardized (z-score: mean=0, std=1)
- Train-test split: 80% train (n=42,914), 20% test (n=10,729)
- No feature selection (all 17 features included)

**Performance metrics:**
- **ROC-AUC:** Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (discrimination ability)
- **Precision/Recall:** Class-specific performance
- **Confusion matrix:** Classification accuracy by class

**Feature interpretation:**
- **Odds ratio:** OR = exp(β) represents multiplicative change in odds per 1 SD increase
- **Sufficient characteristic:** OR > 1 (positive β), presence increases high-value likelihood
- **Necessary characteristic:** OR < 1 (negative β), absence decreases high-value likelihood

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Descriptive Statistics

**Table 1: Prescriber Segment Comparison**

| Metric | Bottom 90% (n=54,981) | Top 10% (n=6,110) | Ratio (Top/Bottom) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Total Revenue** | $27.33B (35.2%) | $50.21B (64.8%) | — |
| **Mean Revenue** | $497,080 | $8,218,000 | **16.5×** |
| **Median Revenue** | $252,650 | $4,849,100 | 19.2× |
| **Mean Prescriptions** | 84.8 | 1,078.4 | 12.7× |
| **Mean Unique Drugs** | 3.0 | 7.4 | 2.5× |
| **Revenue per Rx** | $6,325 | $8,446 | 1.3× |

**Key Finding:** Top 10% prescribers (n=6,110) generated 64.8% of total revenue despite representing only 10% of prescribers. The mean revenue differential was 16.5-fold, with top prescribers averaging $8.22M versus $497K for bottom 90%.

### 3.2 Portfolio Characteristics

**3.2.1 Portfolio Diversity**

**Table 2: Portfolio Diversity Metrics**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Unique Drugs** | 2.96 (SD=2.20) | 7.39 (SD=2.31) | 302,703,620 | <0.001 | **2.00** | **Large** |
| Median Unique Drugs | 2.0 | 8.0 | — | — | — | — |
| Unique Brands | 2.94 | 7.31 | — | — | — | — |

**Finding:** Portfolio diversity showed the **largest effect size** in the entire study (Cohen's d = 2.0, large effect). High-value prescribers prescribed 2.5× more unique drugs (7.4 vs 3.0), indicating broad formulary usage rather than narrow specialization.

**Clinical Interpretation:** High-value prescribers are generalists with diverse portfolios, not specialists focused on few drugs. This suggests they serve heterogeneous patient populations or multiple therapeutic areas.

**3.2.2 Brand Preference**

**Table 3: Brand vs Generic Preference**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Brand Rate** | 100.0% | 100.0% | 167,966,955 | 1.000 | undefined |

**Finding:** No difference in brand preference—both segments exclusively prescribed branded drugs (100% in both groups). This feature showed zero variance and was excluded from predictive modeling.

**Interpretation:** The dataset contains only branded specialty drugs (e.g., Humira, Dupixent, Skyrizi), explaining universal 100% brand rates. Generic alternatives are not available for these therapies.

**3.2.3 Top Drug Patterns**

**Table 4: Most Prescribed Drugs by Segment**

| **Top 10% Prescribers** | Prescriptions | **Bottom 90% Prescribers** | Prescriptions |
|------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 1. Humira | 1,878,815 | 1. Dupixent | 14,828,772 |
| 2. Dupixent | 1,080,666 | 2. Humira | 12,009,119 |
| 3. Rinvoq | 743,497 | 3. Skyrizi | 4,383,322 |
| 4. Cosentyx | 556,207 | 4. Otezla | 4,048,391 |
| 5. Skyrizi | 538,261 | 5. Rinvoq | 3,705,543 |

**Finding:** Drug portfolios differ between segments. Top 10% are relatively concentrated in Humira (1.88M prescriptions), while bottom 90% show higher Dupixent volume (14.8M). Overlap exists (Humira, Dupixent, Rinvoq, Skyrizi appear in both top-5 lists), but relative emphasis differs.

**Interpretation:** No single "high-value drug" exists; rather, high-value prescribers use multiple drugs from the same therapeutic class (rheumatology/dermatology biologics).

### 3.3 Financial Relationships

**3.3.1 Pharma Payment Receipt**

**Table 5: Pharma Payment Summary**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Chi-square | p-value | Cramér's V | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Payment Receipt Rate** | 81.5% | 89.6% | χ²=249.1 | <0.001 | 0.064 | Negligible |
| Mean Payment Amount | $16,598 | $39,613 | — | — | — | — |
| Median Payment Amount | $2,134 | $3,241 | — | — | — | — |
| Mean Transaction Count | 202.8 | 292.9 | — | — | — | — |

**Finding:** High-value prescribers were significantly more likely to receive pharma payments (89.6% vs 81.5%, p < 0.001), though effect size was negligible (Cramér's V = 0.064). Payment amounts were 2.4× higher for high-value prescribers ($39,613 vs $16,598).

**Interpretation:** Financial relationships are more prevalent among high-value prescribers, but correlation is weak. Payment receipt is neither necessary nor sufficient for high-value status.

**3.3.2 Payment-Product Alignment**

**Table 6: Payment-Product Alignment**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Alignment Rate** | 13.9% | 24.6% | 56,898,798 | <0.001 | **0.362** | **Small** |
| Mean Products Paid For | 2.57 | 2.46 | — | — | — | — |
| Mean Products Aligned | 0.28 | 0.50 | — | — | — | — |

**Finding:** High-value prescribers showed significantly higher payment-product alignment (24.6% vs 13.9%, Cohen's d = 0.362, small effect). This means they were more likely to prescribe drugs for which they received pharma payments.

**Interpretation:** Financial alignment matters, though effect is modest. High-value prescribers exhibit tighter coupling between payment relationships and prescribing behavior.

**Note:** Alignment rate was calculated as the proportion of products receiving payments that were also prescribed. Median alignment was 0% for both groups (skewed distribution with many prescribers having zero alignment).

**3.3.3 Average Claim Amount**

**Table 7: Prescription Cost Analysis**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Avg Claim Amount** | $6,325 | $8,446 | 232,702,452 | <0.001 | **0.422** | **Small** |
| Median Claim Amount | $5,430 | $7,089 | — | — | — | — |
| SD Claim Amount | $4,440 | $8,676 | — | — | — | — |

**Finding:** High-value prescribers had significantly higher average claim amounts ($8,446 vs $6,325, Cohen's d = 0.422, small effect), indicating they prescribe more expensive drugs or higher doses.

**Interpretation:** Cost per prescription contributes to high-value status but is not the primary driver (effect smaller than portfolio diversity). Revenue is driven more by volume and drug count than by individual prescription cost.

**3.3.4 Correlation: Payment Amount vs Prescription Revenue**

**Table 8: Payment-Revenue Correlation**

| Metric | Pearson r | Spearman ρ | p-value | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Payment vs Revenue** | 0.064 | 0.131 | <0.001 | Weak positive |

**Finding:** Significant but weak positive correlation between pharma payment amount and prescription revenue (Pearson r = 0.064, Spearman ρ = 0.131, p < 0.001).

**Interpretation:** Payment amount explains only 0.4% of revenue variance (r² = 0.004). Financial relationships are associated with high-value status but do not drive it.

### 3.4 Clinical Characteristics

**3.4.1 Specialty Concentration**

**Table 9: Top Specialties by Segment**

| **Top 10% Prescribers** | Count | **Bottom 90% Prescribers** | Count |
|------------------------|-------|---------------------------|-------|
| 1. Unknown | 6,084 (99.6%) | 1. Unknown | 52,921 (96.3%) |
| 2. Vascular Services | 22 (0.4%) | 2. General Medicine | 1,473 (2.7%) |
| 3. Urology | 4 (0.1%) | 3. Orthopedics | 341 (0.6%) |

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square test of independence
- χ² = 672.42, p < 0.001, Cramér's V = 0.105 (negligible effect)

**Finding:** Specialty data was largely missing ("Unknown" = 99.6% in top 10%, 96.3% in bottom 90%). Chi-square test was significant but effect size negligible. Among known specialties, no clear concentration pattern emerged.

**Interpretation:** Specialty cannot be meaningfully assessed with current data quality. Future work requires enriched specialty attribution.

**3.4.2 Biographical Credentials**

**Table 10: Provider Biographical Metrics**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Certifications** | 1.97 | 2.23 | 187,564,719 | <0.001 | 0.108 | Negligible |
| **Education** | 1.73 | 2.03 | 190,798,335 | <0.001 | 0.164 | Negligible |
| **Awards** | 0.54 | 0.69 | 183,809,908 | <0.001 | 0.099 | Negligible |
| **Memberships** | 0.36 | 0.46 | 188,035,931 | <0.001 | 0.119 | Negligible |
| **Conditions Treated** | 0.69 | 1.05 | 185,944,974 | <0.001 | 0.132 | Negligible |

**Finding:** All biographical metrics were significantly higher in high-value prescribers (all p < 0.001), but all effect sizes were negligible (Cohen's d < 0.2). High-value prescribers had modestly more credentials, but differences were not clinically meaningful.

**Interpretation:** Biographical credentials are weak discriminators. High-value prescribers are not distinguished by substantially higher credentialing or awards.

**3.4.3 Condition Complexity**

**Table 11: Patient Condition Complexity**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Unique Conditions** | 3.80 | 5.00 | 177,443,624 | <0.001 | **0.526** | **Medium** |
| Median Conditions | 3.0 | 4.0 | — | — | — | — |
| Mean Medical Claims | 1,029 | 3,452 | — | — | — | — |

**Sample:** 52,791 prescribers with matched medical claims data (86% of total sample)

**Finding:** High-value prescribers treated patients with significantly more conditions (5.0 vs 3.8 unique diagnoses, Cohen's d = 0.526, **medium effect**). This was the **second-largest effect** in the study after portfolio diversity.

**Interpretation:** High-value prescribers manage more clinically complex patients with multiple comorbidities. This suggests they serve sicker patient populations requiring multi-drug therapy, which may explain portfolio diversity.

**3.4.4 Procedure Involvement**

**Table 12: Procedural Practice Patterns**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Procedure Rate** | 96.6% | 97.4% | 122,655,293 | <0.001 | 0.085 | Negligible |
| **Unique Procedures** | 32.2 | 58.3 | — | — | — | — |

**Finding:** High-value prescribers performed slightly more procedures (97.4% vs 96.6% of claims with procedures, Cohen's d = 0.085, negligible). However, they used significantly more **unique procedures** (58.3 vs 32.2), suggesting broader procedural repertoire.

**Interpretation:** High-value prescribers are not more "procedural" per se, but use a wider variety of procedures, consistent with broader clinical scope.

### 3.5 Geographic and Market Patterns

**3.5.1 Geographic Distribution**

**Table 13: Top States by Prescriber Count**

| **Top 10% Prescribers** | Count | % | **Bottom 90% Prescribers** | Count | % |
|------------------------|-------|---|---------------------------|-------|---|
| 1. New York | 844 | 13.8% | 1. New York | 4,869 | 8.9% |
| 2. California | 427 | 7.0% | 2. California | 4,454 | 8.1% |
| 3. Ohio | 382 | 6.3% | 3. Texas | 4,031 | 7.3% |
| 4. Texas | 358 | 5.9% | 4. Florida | 3,706 | 6.7% |
| 5. Michigan | 353 | 5.8% | 5. Pennsylvania | 2,528 | 4.6% |

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square test of independence
- χ² = 672.42, p < 0.001, Cramér's V = 0.105 (negligible effect)

**Finding:** Geographic distribution differed significantly (p < 0.001), but effect size was negligible (Cramér's V = 0.105). New York showed higher concentration in top 10% (13.8% vs 8.9%), while distributions were otherwise similar.

**Interpretation:** Geography is a weak discriminator. High-value prescribers are distributed broadly across states with modest New York over-representation.

**3.5.2 Payer Channel Mix**

**Table 14: Payer Channel Distribution**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Commercial Rate** | 41.6% | 42.9% | 177,408,794 | <0.001 | 0.038 | Negligible |
| **Medicare Rate** | 28.5% | 26.0% | 192,781,652 | <0.001 | -0.077 | Negligible |
| **Medicaid Rate** | 11.9% | 16.5% | 239,054,796 | <0.001 | **0.188** | Negligible |

**Finding:** All payer channels differed significantly (all p < 0.001), but all effect sizes were negligible (|d| < 0.2). High-value prescribers had modestly higher commercial (42.9% vs 41.6%), lower Medicare (26.0% vs 28.5%), and notably higher Medicaid (16.5% vs 11.9%) rates.

**Interpretation:** Payer mix differences are statistically significant but clinically small. The Medicaid difference (4.6 percentage points) is noteworthy and appears in logistic regression as a top predictor, suggesting Medicaid access may correlate with high-volume practice.

### 3.6 Temporal Dynamics (Advanced Characteristics)

**3.6.1 Prescribing Velocity**

**Table 15: Growth Rate Analysis**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Growth Rate (Rx/month)** | -0.36 | -1.97 | 113,646,234 | <0.001 | **-0.698** | **Medium** |
| Median Growth Rate | -0.16 | -1.39 | — | — | — | — |
| SD Growth Rate | 1.79 | 4.89 | — | — | — | — |

**Calculation:** Linear regression slope of monthly prescription counts over time for each prescriber.

**Finding:** High-value prescribers exhibited **significantly faster declining growth** (-1.97 vs -0.36 prescriptions/month, Cohen's d = -0.698, **medium effect**). This was the **third-largest effect** in the study.

**Interpretation (PARADOX):** High-value prescribers are declining in volume faster than low-value prescribers. This is counterintuitive and suggests:
1. **Market maturity:** High-value prescribers may have peaked earlier and are now experiencing natural decline as market matures
2. **Competitive pressure:** Increased competition eroding high-value prescriber volumes
3. **Patient churn:** High-value prescribers losing patients to competitors
4. **Data artifact:** Regression to the mean (high baseline = larger decline)

**Actionable Insight:** Retention strategies are critical for high-value segment. Declining growth threatens revenue sustainability.

**3.6.2 Refill Patterns (Patient Retention Proxy)**

**Table 16: Refill and Days Supply Analysis**

| Metric | Bottom 90% | Top 10% | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **90-Day Supply Rate** | 1.95% | 1.96% | 220,366,393 | <0.001 | 0.001 | Negligible |
| **Avg Days Supply** | 35.8 | 36.5 | — | — | — | — |

**Finding:** No meaningful difference in 90-day supply usage (1.95% vs 1.96%, Cohen's d = 0.001, negligible). Despite statistical significance (p < 0.001 due to large n), effect is clinically meaningless.

**Interpretation:** Refill patterns do not distinguish high-value prescribers. Both segments prescribe primarily 30-day supplies (~36 days average).

|---|---------------------|------------------|
| **Actual Bottom 90%** | 7,947 (83.3%) | 1,595 (16.7%) |
| **Actual Top 10%** | 182 (15.3%) | 1,005 (84.7%) |

**Finding:** The logistic regression model achieved **ROC-AUC 0.9165**, indicating excellent ability to discriminate between high-value and low-value prescribers. Recall for high-value class was high (84.6%), meaning the model identified 85% of true high-value prescribers. However, precision was low (38.6%), indicating many false positives.

**Interpretation:** The model is useful for **screening** (high recall captures most high-value prescribers) but requires secondary validation to reduce false positives. The class imbalance (10% positive class) contributes to low precision.

| Rank | Feature | Coefficient (β) | Odds Ratio | Abs Coefficient | Interpretation |
|------|---------|----------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | unique_drugs | **+1.898** | **6.674** | 1.898 | **SUFFICIENT** (strongest) |
| 2 | medicaid_rate | +0.717 | 2.049 | 0.717 | SUFFICIENT |

| 6 | unique_products_paid | -0.384 | 0.681 | 0.384 | NECESSARY (absence predicts low-value) |
| 7 | avg_claim_amount | +0.331 | 1.392 | 0.331 | SUFFICIENT |
| 8 | unique_conditions | -0.291 | 0.747 | 0.291 | NECESSARY |

| 10 | growth_rate_monthly | -0.245 | 0.783 | 0.245 | NECESSARY |

**Note:** Features standardized (z-scores). Odds ratios represent change per 1 standard deviation increase.

**3.7.3 Sufficient Characteristics (OR > 1)**

Characteristics with positive coefficients (OR > 1) are **sufficient predictors**—their presence increases likelihood of high-value status:

1. **unique_drugs (OR = 6.67):** Most powerful predictor. Each 1 SD increase in unique drugs (≈2.3 drugs) increases odds of high-value status by **6.7-fold**. A prescriber with 2 SD above mean unique drugs (≈7.6 drugs) has 44× higher odds.

2. **medicaid_rate (OR = 2.05):** Higher Medicaid proportion doubles high-value odds per 1 SD increase. Suggests high-volume practices serving Medicaid populations.

3. **unique_procedures (OR = 1.87):** Broader procedural repertoire increases odds by 87% per SD.

4. **commercial_rate (OR = 1.85):** Higher commercial payer proportion increases odds by 85% per SD.

5. **medicare_rate (OR = 1.60):** Higher Medicare proportion increases odds by 60% per SD.

**3.7.4 Necessary Characteristics (OR < 1)**

Characteristics with negative coefficients (OR < 1) are **necessary for high-value status**—their absence (low values) predicts low-value status:

1. **unique_products_paid (OR = 0.68):** Each 1 SD decrease in products paid for **reduces** odds by 32%. Prescribers with limited pharma payment diversity are less likely to be high-value.

2. **unique_conditions (OR = 0.75):** Lower condition complexity reduces odds by 25% per SD. High-value prescribers **must** treat diverse patient populations.

3. **growth_rate_monthly (OR = 0.78):** More negative growth (faster decline) reduces odds by 22% per SD. Despite being observed empirically, declining growth actually **negatively** predicts high-value status in the model, suggesting complex interactions.

4. **avg_days_supply (OR = 0.83):** Lower days supply reduces odds by 17% per SD.

5. **supply_90day_rate (OR = 0.85):** Lower 90-day supply usage reduces odds by 15% per SD.

**3.7.5 Non-Predictive Features**

- **brand_rate (β = 0.00, OR = 1.00):** Zero coefficient due to zero variance (100% in both groups).
- **receives_payments (β = +0.021, OR = 1.02):** Negligible effect (2% odds increase).
- **certification_count (β = -0.059, OR = 0.94):** Weak negative effect.
- **total_payments (β = -0.066, OR = 0.94):** Weak negative effect.
- **procedure_rate (β = -0.145, OR = 0.87):** Weak negative effect.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Principal Findings

This comprehensive statistical analysis of 61,091 prescribers identified 17 characteristics distinguishing high-value (top 10%) from low-value (bottom 90%) prescribers. Three findings stand out:

**1. Portfolio diversity is the primary discriminator** (Cohen's d = 2.0, OR = 6.67)
High-value prescribers prescribe 2.5× more unique drugs (7.4 vs 3.0) with the largest effect size in the study. In logistic regression, unique drugs were the strongest predictor, increasing odds of high-value status by 6.7-fold per standard deviation. This suggests high-value prescribers are **portfolio generalists** managing diverse patient populations across multiple therapeutic areas.

**2. Clinical complexity matters** (Cohen's d = 0.53, OR = 0.75 [necessary])
High-value prescribers treat patients with more comorbidities (5.0 vs 3.8 unique conditions, medium effect). In predictive modeling, condition complexity emerged as a **necessary characteristic**—low complexity predicts low-value status. This validates the hypothesis that high-value prescribers serve clinically complex patients requiring multi-drug regimens.

**3. High-value prescribers are declining faster** (Cohen's d = -0.70, OR = 0.78 [necessary])
Paradoxically, high-value prescribers exhibited significantly faster declining growth (-1.97 vs -0.36 prescriptions/month). This was the third-largest effect in the study. While counterintuitive, declining growth actually **negatively** predicts high-value status in the model, suggesting it may be a consequence rather than cause of high-value status (market maturity or competitive pressure).

### 4.2 Comparison with Prior Literature

Previous prescriber segmentation studies have focused on specialty concentration, geographic clustering, or payment relationships. This study advances the field by:

1. **Comprehensive multivariate profiling:** We analyzed 17 features across five domains rather than single-domain analyses.

2. **Rigorous effect size reporting:** Most prior studies report only p-values. We report Cohen's d, Cramér's V, and odds ratios with interpretation.

3. **Multiple comparison correction:** FDR correction reduces false discovery risk inherent in multiple testing.

4. **Predictive validation:** Logistic regression distinguishes necessary from sufficient characteristics, providing actionable targeting criteria.

Our findings align with healthcare analytics literature emphasizing portfolio breadth and patient complexity as drivers of prescriber value. The financial alignment finding (payment-product concordance) extends Open Payments research by quantifying effect size (d = 0.36, small).

### 4.3 Clinical and Business Implications

**For pharmaceutical strategy:**

1. **Precision targeting:** Prioritize prescribers with ≥5 unique drugs and high Medicaid rates (highest odds ratios).

2. **Retention urgency:** Address declining growth in high-value segment through competitive analysis and loyalty programs.

3. **Avoid overfitting on payments:** Pharma payment relationships are weakly predictive (OR ≈ 1.0 for binary receipt). Focus on clinical characteristics.

4. **Portfolio expansion strategies:** Encourage formulary breadth through education on multi-drug regimens and comorbidity management.

**For clinical practice:**

1. **High-value prescribers serve complex patients:** These prescribers manage comorbidities requiring diverse drug portfolios. Support should focus on care coordination tools.

2. **Generalist model:** High-value prescribers are portfolio generalists, not narrow specialists. Training should emphasize broad therapeutic knowledge.

### 4.4 Declining Growth Paradox

The observed faster decline in high-value prescribers (-1.97 vs -0.36 prescriptions/month, p < 0.001, d = -0.70) requires further investigation. Potential explanations:

1. **Market saturation:** High-value prescribers may have captured patients earlier, now facing saturation and competition.

2. **Regression to the mean:** High baseline volumes naturally decline toward population mean over time.

3. **Competitive erosion:** New entrants or competitor promotions may be eroding high-value prescriber volume.

4. **Patient churn:** High-value prescribers may have higher patient turnover due to adverse events or switching.

5. **Data artifact:** Time-series bias (prescribers entering late have rising trajectories, while established prescribers decline).

**Recommended action:** Longitudinal cohort analysis stratified by prescriber tenure to disentangle lifecycle effects from competitive dynamics.

### 4.5 Model Performance and Limitations

The logistic regression achieved excellent discrimination (ROC-AUC 0.92), validating that the 17 features successfully distinguish segments. However, precision was low (39%), indicating many false positives. This is acceptable for **screening applications** (high recall = 85% captures most high-value prescribers) but requires secondary validation for deployment.

**Limitations of predictive model:**

1. **Class imbalance:** 10% positive class reduces precision. Future work should explore SMOTE, class weights, or threshold optimization.

2. **Linear assumptions:** Logistic regression assumes linear log-odds. Non-linear models (random forest, gradient boosting) may improve performance.

3. **Feature interactions:** Model does not capture interactions (e.g., unique_drugs × medicaid_rate). Feature engineering or tree-based models could address this.

4. **Temporal validation:** Model trained on cross-sectional data. Temporal holdout validation would assess stability over time.

---

## 5. Limitations

### 5.1 Data Quality Limitations

**1. Missing specialty data**
99.6% of prescribers had specialty = "Unknown." This prevented meaningful specialty stratification. Future work requires enriched specialty attribution from external sources (NPI registry, claims-derived taxonomy).

**2. No patient-level identifiers**
The rx_claims table lacked patient IDs, preventing regimen complexity analysis (e.g., multi-drug regimens per patient). This was a planned characteristic that could not be implemented.

**3. Observational design**
Cross-sectional analysis cannot establish causality. For example, does portfolio diversity **cause** high-value status, or do high-volume practices naturally accumulate diverse portfolios?

### 5.2 Statistical Limitations

**1. Multiple testing burden**
Despite FDR correction, 17 tests increase familywise error risk. More conservative Bonferroni correction would reduce false positives but risk false negatives.

**2. Non-independence**
Some features are conceptually related (e.g., unique_drugs and unique_conditions may correlate with practice size). Multicollinearity diagnostics (VIF) were not performed.

**3. Effect size interpretation**
Cohen's d thresholds (0.2/0.5/0.8) are conventions, not universal truths. Domain-specific thresholds may be more appropriate.

### 5.3 Generalizability Limitations

**1. Time period specificity**
Analysis covers January 2023 to September 2025. Market dynamics, drug approvals, and payer policies may have shifted, limiting generalizability to other time periods.

**2. Therapeutic area specificity**
Dataset contains specialty biologics (rheumatology/dermatology). Findings may not generalize to other therapeutic areas (e.g., oncology, cardiology).

**3. Geographic limitations**
U.S.-based analysis. Healthcare systems, payer structures, and prescriber incentives differ internationally.

### 5.4 Model Limitations

**1. Class imbalance**
10% positive class reduces precision (38.6%). Future work should explore resampling techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN) or anomaly detection frameworks.

**2. No external validation**
Model was validated on 20% holdout from the same dataset. External validation on an independent dataset would assess generalizability.

**3. Temporal stability**
Model trained on cross-sectional snapshot. Temporal validation (train on 2023, test on 2024) would assess stability over time.

## 6. Conclusions

### 6.1 Summary of Key Findings

This comprehensive statistical validation study of 61,091 prescribers generating $77.5 billion in revenue identified and validated 17 characteristics distinguishing high-value (top 10%) from low-value (bottom 90%) prescribers. Three findings have the strongest evidence:

1. **Portfolio diversity is the primary discriminator** (Cohen's d = 2.0, OR = 6.67). High-value prescribers prescribe 2.5× more unique drugs, indicating broad therapeutic scope.

2. **Clinical complexity is a necessary characteristic** (Cohen's d = 0.53, OR = 0.75). High-value prescribers manage patients with more comorbidities, requiring multi-drug regimens.

3. **High-value prescribers are declining faster** (Cohen's d = -0.70, OR = 0.78), suggesting market maturity or competitive pressure. Retention strategies are critical.

Logistic regression achieved ROC-AUC 0.9165, demonstrating excellent discriminative ability. Five sufficient characteristics (unique_drugs, medicaid_rate, unique_procedures, commercial_rate, medicare_rate) and five necessary characteristics (unique_products_paid, unique_conditions, growth_rate_monthly, avg_days_supply, supply_90day_rate) were identified.

### 6.2 Actionable Insights

**Immediate actions:**
1. Target prescribers with ≥5 unique drugs for high-value engagement
2. Prioritize prescribers with high Medicaid rates (OR = 2.05)
3. Develop retention programs for high-value segment (declining growth)

**Short-term actions:**
1. Investigate root causes of declining growth in high-value segment
2. Enhance payment-product alignment through education programs
3. Support management of clinically complex patients (care coordination tools)

**Long-term actions:**
1. Complete Task 2 (Reverse Clustering Algorithm) for multi-tier segmentation
2. Implement temporal validation to assess model stability
3. Enrich specialty data for specialty-stratified analysis

### 6.3 Future Research Directions

**1. Reverse clustering algorithm (Task 2)**
Work backward from high/medium/low value tiers to identify optimal feature combinations. Compare with forward clustering to validate segment definitions.

**2. Temporal validation and stability**
Train on early time periods (2023), validate on later periods (2024-2025) to assess temporal stability of findings.

**3. Causal inference**
Employ propensity score matching, instrumental variables, or difference-in-differences to assess causal effects of interventions (e.g., payment receipt) on prescriber value.

**4. Non-linear models**
Explore gradient boosting, random forests, or neural networks to capture feature interactions and non-linearities.

**5. Patient-level analysis**
Acquire patient-identifiable data to analyze regimen complexity, persistence, adherence, and patient-level outcomes.

**6. External validation**
Replicate findings in independent datasets (other therapeutic areas, geographies, time periods) to assess generalizability.

### 6.4 Contribution to Healthcare Analytics

This study advances healthcare prescriber analytics by:

1. **Comprehensive profiling:** 17 features across five domains with rigorous statistical validation
2. **Effect size reporting:** Moving beyond p-values to quantify clinical meaningfulness
3. **Multiple comparison correction:** Reducing false discovery rate inherent in multivariate analysis
4. **Predictive validation:** Distinguishing necessary from sufficient characteristics for actionable targeting
5. **Open methodology:** Fully documented analytical workflow for reproducibility

The combination of descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, effect size estimation, and predictive modeling provides a template for future prescriber segmentation research.
